# How we burn tokens

In order to continually increase the value of our token and reward high yield to our investors, we are committed to burn as many tokens as possible. Here are the following measures implemented :

* Buyback Burning Mechanism
* Transfer Tax Burning Mechanism
* Automated inflation reduction
* Automated Referral Reward & Burn

Read the detail here :

**Buyback Burning Mechanism** ðŸ”¥ 

* 4% deposit fee will be charged at staking.
* 40% of the deposit fee \(4%\) will be allocated to buyback MIST and AURUM and burn them.
* 10% of the deposit fee \(4%\) will be allocated to a marketing fund.
* 50% will go the the dev wallet for further development and an emergency fund.
* Buyback burning will happen every day.

**Transfer Tax Burning Mechanism**

* Every transaction \(send, swap, farming, etc.\) of MIST will be charged a 2% transfer tax.
* 2% transfer tax will be burned directly in every transaction.
* Use **2.5%+** slippage to buy MIST and AURUM on Pancake Swap or other AMM. Less than 2% slippage will cause the transaction to fail.

**Automated inflation reduction**

* The initial emission rate is 0.7 MIST and 0.06 AURUM per block, to provide initial liquidity. 
* The emission rate will be reduced by 5% every 9,600 blocks \(~8 hours\) automatically until it reaches 0.3 MIST and 0.001 AURUM per block. 
* Our emission rate reduction logic is coded in the smart contract and will be executed once automatically every 8 hours.

**Automated Referral Reward & Burn**

* Users of the platform can invite their friends using referral links, allowing them to profit from organic marketing
* Using a referral link doesn't decrease the reward for the referred. Reward tokens are minted for the referrer, allowing for a fair profit-sharing system.
* In case a user does not have a referrer, the additional reward is burnt, to reduce natural inflation.
